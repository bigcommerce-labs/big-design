# Iconography

Our system uses Google’s Material Symbols “Rounded” set.  
See: [Material Symbols](https://bigcommercecloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/417333457/Iconography#:~:text=Rounded%E2%80%9D%20set.%0ASee%3A-,Material%20Symbols,-Introducing%20new%20icons "https://bigcommercecloud.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/417333457/Iconography#:~:text=Rounded%E2%80%9D%20set.%0ASee%3A-,Material%20Symbols,-Introducing%20new%20icons") 

Introducing new icons to our system is allowed, as long as they are from the Google Material Symbols and follow usage guidelines.

## Icon sizes

Our system uses 2 sets of sizes to allow for flexibility of use cases. Padding is built into icon assets. Icons should not be used outside of their frame.

- **24px:** Our primary icon set
- **16px:** Our dense UI set (To be used when space is constrained or in conjunction with in-line copy)

## Icon types

- **Status icons,** or non-actionable icons, are used to provide additional visual cues. They are used in conjunction with text. 
- **Action icons** can be interacted with and can either be used independantly or in conjunction with text.

## Alternate text for visually impaired users

Provide “alt-text” for all graphic assets to meet Section 508 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. [Learn more](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H37.html "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H37.html").

## Use cases

Order Details: icons are used as visual cues to differentiate many different data types.

Bulk Edit: Edit and Delete icons are used in lieu of copy due to space considerations.

Catalog Import/Export: Confirmation and Error icons are used to provide additional context into Import/Export status.

## Custom Icons

Should there be the need of creating a custom icon that does not exist in the  [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons "https://fonts.google.com/icons") library, follow the [design principles provided by Google](https://m3.material.io/styles/icons/designing-icons) in the creation of new glyphs.
