# Color

## Overview

The BigDesign color system has five palette types named semantically for their use across the application. The color system is derived from the BigCommerce brand and provides a consistent user experience for our merchants and partners.

BigDesign uses color tokens to manage colors within each palette and are named for their role or hierarchy in the palette. Color tokens improve communication between design and development and establish an organized use of color in the BigCommerce application.

## Visual Accessibility Standards

The BigDesign color palette is consistent with the WCAG 2.0 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), specifically in regards to foreground and background color when it comes to the legibility of text. You can learn more about [WCAG standards here.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ "https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"). 

In terms of contrast and legibility: WCAG provides an equation that outputs a number between 0 and 21, with 21 being the highest amount of contrast—black text and a white background—and 0 being no contrast—white on white.

**AAA**  
AAA means that your text has a contrast ratio of at least 7.0.  
This is an example of AAA contrast.

**AA**  
AA means that your text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 or higher.  
<span style={{'color':'#006644'}}> This is an example of AA contrast.</span>

**AA+**  
AA+ means that your text has a contrast ratio of at least 3.0.  
<span style={{'color':'#206b74'}}>This is an example of AA+ contrast.</span>

**Fail**  
Fail means that your text has a contrast ratio of 2.9 or lower. (This does not apply to logos, text in logos, and other decorative elements.)  
<span style={{'color':'#dfd8fd'}}>This is an example of Fail contrast.</span>
