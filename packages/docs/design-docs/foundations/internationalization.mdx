# Internationalization

BigCommerce having a global target audience has to abide to internationalization aspects to better serve different languages and cultural contexts. Taking this to our design system context means designing and developing components and patterns that can be easily adapted to different languages and cultures.

There are several aspects of internationalization that should be considered when creating components and patterns for BigDesign. These include:

1.  **Text and Typography:** Choose fonts and typography that can support different languages and writing systems. For example, certain languages like Arabic and Hebrew are read from right to left, while others like English are read from left to right. Designers and developers should consider how text and typography will look and behave when used in different languages.
    
2.  **Icons and Imagery:** Icons and imagery should also be designed with internationalization in mind. Designers should consider using culturally neutral symbols and icons that can be easily understood across different languages and cultures. If specific symbols are used, designers should consider how they may be interpreted differently in different cultures.
    
3.  **Color:** Colors have different meanings and associations in different cultures. However there is a standard defined for road signs that was first defined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in 1935 and later on adopted in the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals, that is largely adopted across the world that uses specific colors for road and traffic information and status.  
    According to the convention, there are four main colors used on traffic signs:
    
    1.  **Red:** This color is used to indicate prohibitions or to draw attention to dangerous situations. This is why we use the red shades within the design system to convey the error status.
        
    2.  **Blue:** Blue signs are used to convey information to drivers, such as directions or guidance. Hence the blue shades are used for informational status and CTAs.
        
    3.  **Green:** Green signs are used to indicate permitted actions, such as the direction of an exit or the location of a hospital. This is why we use the shades of green to convey success and positive statues.
        
    4.  **Yellow:** This color is used to indicate warnings or to draw attention to temporary or unexpected situations, hence the use within BigDesign to convey warning messages and statuses.  
          
        
4.  **Language Support:** BigDesign supports different languages and scripts, including those that are written from right to left. Designers and developers should consider how text and typography will behave when used in different languages and ensure that the system can accommodate different character sets.
    
5.  **Accessibility:** Finally, internationalization should be considered from an accessibility perspective. Designers should ensure that the design system is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, and that components and patterns are designed with accessibility in mind.
    

In conclusion, designing a design system with internationalization in mind is essential for creating products and services that can be adapted to different languages and cultural contexts. By considering aspects such as text and typography, icons and imagery, color, language support, and accessibility, designers can create design systems that are inclusive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their language or cultural background.
