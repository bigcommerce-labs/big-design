# BigDesign

Our design language system and component library was built to enable designers and developers to build experiences that seamlessly integrate with the BigCommerce product ecosystem.

## BigDesign principles

### One system

Any and all of our components should look and feel to be connected, part of one consistent system. We take care to optimize for each unique context and need, while respecting what we've already built and ensuring each element fits into this system seamlessly.

### Make the primary obvious and alternatives discoverable

We provide upfront access to the most relevant information -- no guessing games. The state is always clear and additional details are easily discovered.

### Follow standards until they fail

We start with patterns that are standard on the market and are familiar to our audience - we don't reinvent the wheel. Only when established patterns fail do we invent a new approach, after sufficient vetting.

### Opinionated by default; flexible by choice

We provide relevant presets and defaults up front to fast-track setup and streamline launch for everyone. At the same time, there is flexibility under the hood so the system can be configured for specific, nuanced needs.

### Respect expertise, but be there to help

Our designs reflect that we are connecting with real people, busy professionals who already have e-commerce knowledge. We explain just enough to help our users move forward. But we make sure to give them the info they need when they need it.

### What you ship makes the impact

We aim to solve real merchant and partner problems, and are guided by metrics that provide meaningful signals. What matters is whether we solved the problem and how we measure success.
