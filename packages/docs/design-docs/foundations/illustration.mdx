# Illustration

Illustrations within our design vision can have numerous benefits, both for the user experience and for the overall success of the product.

Illustrations can be used to communicate complex ideas or processes in a simple and visually appealing way. This can be particularly helpful for products that are aimed at a wide audience, as it can help to reduce confusion and improve engagement.

Illustrations can also help to create an emotional connection between the user and the product. By using appealing and relatable illustrations, a product can convey a sense of personality, which can help to build trust and loyalty. Additionally, illustrations can be used to create a sense of fun and playfulness, which can make a product more enjoyable to use and increase the chances of repeat use.

The benefits can be summarized as improving communication, creating emotional connections, and enhancing visual appeal.

## When to use

Within BigDesign illustrations are mainly used to enhance the overall aesthetic of a product and make it stand out, particularly in situations of new feature onboarding or when there’s a necessity of driving user’s attention to a message we want to deliver.

## Illustration style

BigDesign currently uses Illustrations in the style of the **unDraw** illustration library.

The illustrations on unDraw are available in SVG format, which means that they can be easily customized and integrated into different projects without losing quality. Additionally, the illustrations are available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license, which means that they can be used for both personal and commercial projects, as long as the original author is credited.

To customize the illustrations we use BC Blue (#0D52FF) within our primary brand colors as the main color accent.

<Swatch color="#0D52FF" name="BC Blue"> `#0D52FF`</Swatch>

If the illustrations within unDraw do not fit a particular idea or subject it is possible to create a custom composition by following the same visual aesthetic.
