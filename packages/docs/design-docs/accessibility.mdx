# Accessibility

A foundational aspect of BigDesign is creating a consistent visual language that is accessible to all users. This means choosing a color palette that meets contrast requirements and using typography that is easy to read for people with visual impairments. BigDesign also include guidelines for creating accessible icons and images, such as providing alternative text descriptions or using descriptive file names. By focusing on these foundational aspects, designers can ensure that their designs are accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.

## WCAG

1. **Improved Accessibility:** By adhering to WCAG standards, web developers can ensure that their applications are accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. This can help to remove barriers and provide equal access to information and services for everyone.

2. **Better User Experience:** Accessibility features like keyboard navigation, alt tags, and high contrast color schemes can benefit all users, not just those with disabilities. These features can make it easier for users to navigate and interact with web applications, leading to a better user experience.

3. **Increased Legal Compliance:** In many countries, there are laws that require websites and web applications to be accessible to people with disabilities. By following WCAG standards, web developers can ensure that their applications comply with these laws and avoid legal issues.

4. **Improved SEO:** WCAG standards can also help to improve search engine optimization (SEO) for web applications. For example, adding alt tags to images can help search engines to better understand the content of a page, leading to higher rankings in search results.

5. **Future-Proofing:** By designing and developing web applications with WCAG standards in mind, developers can ensure that their applications are future-proofed. As new devices and technologies emerge, WCAG compliance can help to ensure that web applications remain accessible and usable for everyone.

In conclusion, using WCAG standards in web applications can provide a wide range of benefits, including improved accessibility, better user experience, legal compliance, improved SEO, and future-proofing. By following these guidelines, web developers can create applications that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities, and provide a better user experience for all users.
