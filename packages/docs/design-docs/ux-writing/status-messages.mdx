# Status messages

Status messages help the user to understand what is happening in the application. Their common instances are success, warning and error messages.

## Basic guidelines

### Keep it simple

Messages should be short and to the point. Focus on what happened and what the user needs to do to move forward. When applicable, include a link to the place where the user can act upon what's being announced.

### Avoid vague language

Don’t start status messages with “It seems like…” or “It looks like….” It sounds like we don’t know what went wrong. There’s no room for ambiguity — especially when we’re trying to confirm a potentially destructive action.

<Donts>
  <div className="hidden">**Don't**</div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center">

    messages](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/big-design/big-design.ux-writing-guide.interactions-status-messages_vague_language.png)
  </div>
</Donts>

### Use positive language

Don’t use scary or dramatic words like “bad,” “forbidden,” “fatal,” “failed,” “unresolved,” “invalid” etc.

### Don’t mention error codes

Error codes mean nothing to the average user.

### Avoid using “please”

Only use “please” when asking the user to go out of their way to do something they might find inconvenient.

### Avoid humor

Words and phrases like “Whoops” or “Oh no!” could be taken as inconsiderate, even insulting.

<Donts>
  <div className="hidden">**Don't**</div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center">

  </div>
</Donts>

### Follow the &#123;verb&#125; + &#123;noun&#125; formula.

Use supporting copy to provide additional context as needed.

<Dos>
  <div className="hidden">**Do**</div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
    ![Confirmation
    example](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/big-design/big-design.ux-writing-guide.interactions-confirmations-supporting_copy.png)
  </div>
</Dos>

### Don’t ask vague questions

“Are you sure?” About what? It’s not clear to the user what we’re trying to confirm.

<Donts>
  <div className="hidden">**Don't**</div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
    ![Don't ask vague
    questions](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/big-design/big-design.ux-writing-guide.interactions-confirmations-vague_questions.png)
  </div>
</Donts>

### Always use “Cancel”

For modal alerts, always use “cancel” when giving the user the option to back out. Never use “stop,” “pause,” “terminate,” “never mind” or “back”

### Write descriptive buttons

When a user clicks a button, whether it’s to confirm an action or cancel one, it should be clear what will happen when they click.

<Dos>
  <div className="hidden">**Do**</div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
    ![Don't use vague
    CTAs](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/big-design/big-design.ux-writing-guide.interactions-confirmations-supporting_copy.png)
  </div>
</Dos>

### Include applicable links

Whenever possible, save the user some trouble and provide a link to the place where the user can fix the error. It’s okay to include “Learn more” links to Knowledge Base articles.

<Dos>
  <div className="hidden">**Do**</div>
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
