# Glossary

We know the discourse of ecommerce changes over time. If we find a word choice in our vocabulary doesn’t make sense anymore, we'll change it.

### 1, 2, 3

<dl className="ml-4">
<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
2-step verification
</dt>
<dd>
Use “2-step verification.” Don’t use “2 step verification” or “two-step verification.”
</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">3D Secure</dt>
<dd>
  3D Secure is a fraud protection layer available to users as long as they’re using a participating
  payment gateway. Treat 3D Secure as a proper noun and capitalize accordingly.
</dd>

</dl>

### A

<dl className="ml-4">

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">able to</dt>
<dd>
  Avoid using sentences using “You will be able to….” Instead, just say “You can….” It’s shorter and
  easier to scan.
</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
add
</dt>
<dd>
Use “add” when referring to the act of putting a thing with another group of things. Compare this with “connect,” which refers to the act of joining two things together.

For example, users can add products to their catalog. They can also connect their BigCommerce site with a marketplace, like Amazon or Facebook.

</dd>
<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
App Marketplace
</dt>
<dd>
App Marketplace is a proper noun. Capitalize both words.
</dd>

</dl>

### B

<dl className="ml-4">

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">back</dt>
<dd>
  “Back” means, “I want to return to the previous step in this workflow without quitting the current
  process.” Don’t use “back” in place of “cancel.”
</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">BigCommerce</dt>
<dd>Use BigCommerce. Don’t use Bigcommerce or Big Commerce. And never abbreviate as BC.</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)</dt>
<dd>Treat “Buy Now, Pay Later” as a branded, proper noun and use title case.</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
buy online, pick up in-store (BOPIS)
</dt>
<dd>
“Pick up” is a verb and should be two words, no hyphen. “In-store” is an adjective describing the type of pick up. In the UK, “buy online, pick up in-store” is called “click and collect.”

At BigCommerce, the default language for UX writing is American English. Accordingly, always use “buy online, pick up in-store.”

Don’t abbreviate as BOPIS.

</dd>

</dl>

### C

<dl className="ml-4">

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
cancel
</dt>
<dd>
“Cancel” means, “I don’t want to do this anymore.” Any in-progress changes should be discarded as a result of clicking the button.

Don’t use “stop,” “pause,” “terminate” or “nevermind” and don’t use “cancel” in place of “back.”

</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">catalog</dt>
<dd>
  A catalog is a collection of virtual representations of a merchant’s saleable products for a
  channel, stored within the BigCommerce platform. A catalog contains products. Products can be both
  physical and digital. For the latter, think music downloads, digital images, treatments, services,
  etc. A collection of products, sorted by the user for merchandising purposes, is called a
  category.
</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">category</dt>
<dd>A collection of products, sorted by the user for merchandising purposes.</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">channel</dt>
<dd>
  A place where a BigCommerce user can market and sell goods. Channels include storefronts,
  marketplaces, advertising and social media.
</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">Channel Manager</dt>
<dd>Channel Manager is a proper noun. Capitalize both words.</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
check out, checkout
</dt>
<dd>
Use check out (verb) when referring to the act of paying for items and creating an order.

Use checkout (noun) when talking about the place shoppers go to pay for items and create an order.

Use checkout (adjective) when describing the type of page or process.

Never use check-out.

</dd>

<Dos>
  <div className="hidden">Do</div>- Ready to check out? - When you’re done shopping, proceed to the
  checkout. - Navigate to the checkout page.
</Dos>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
click
</dt>
<dd>
Since we don’t know if a user is on a desktop or mobile device, avoid using “click” when instructing the user on how to complete an action within the UI. Whenever possible, write around the issue with generic verbs like “choose,” “select” or “pick.”

Avoid using “hit."

</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
clickthrough, click-through
</dt>
<dd>
Use “clickthrough” (noun) when referring to an instance or multiple instances of clickthrough. Use “click through” (verb) when referring to the act of following a link or button to another site or location.

<dd>Use “close” instead of “exit” for modals and pop-ups.</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
connect
</dt>
<dd>
Use “connect” when referring to the act of joining two things together. Compare this to “add,” which refers to the act of putting a thing with another group of things.

For example, users can add products to their catalog. They can also connect their BigCommerce site with a marketplace, like Amazon or Facebook.

When writing about an integration between BigCommerce and another third party technology, you’ll probably be using “connect.”

</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
continue
</dt>
<dd>
“Continue” means “I want to go forward a step in this workflow,” like an onboarding, for example.

Do not use “next.”

</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">control panel</dt>
<dd>
  Control panel is not a proper noun. No need to capitalize. Of course, always capitalize the first
  letter of the first word if it appears at the start of a sentence. Keep in mind, there are very
  few instances when you’ll need to refer to the control panel by name. Most of the time you’ll just
  say “store.”
</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">create</dt>
<dd>
  Use “create,” as opposed to “save,” as the CTA when creating a product, customer, setting, object,
  item etc. for the first time. When making changes to something that already exists, use “save” as
  the CTA.
</dd>

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
customer
</dt>
<dd>
Use “customer” when referring to our users’ end-user: the customer. You can use “customer” and “shopper” interchangeably. Just keep in mind, depending on the context, there can be a subtle difference between a shopper and a customer. A shopper is a visitor to a merchant’s storefront who hasn’t necessarily purchased anything.

To avoid confusion, try not to use “customer” to refer to BigCommerce clients. Use “merchant,” “retailer” or “brand” instead.

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">
optional vs. required
</dt>
<dd>
Label optional fields. Don’t label required fields. More often than not, a given settings page will have more required fields than optional fields. As such, it makes more sense to denote any optional fields as those are the ones deviating from the merchant’s expectations. Not to mention, it’s less cluttered looking than labeling all the required fields.

Also keep in mind, if a given setting has a default option, it’s not an optional setting and shouldn’t be labeled as such.

“Pickup” can be an adjective or a noun. For example, “pickup methods.” In this example “pickup” is acting as an adjective modifying a noun. What kind of methods are these? They are pickup methods.

<dt className="font-bold mt-4">please</dt>
