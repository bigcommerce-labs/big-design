# Glossary

We know the discourse of ecommerce changes over time. If we find a word choice in our vocabulary doesn’t make sense anymore, we'll change it.

### 1, 2, 3

**2-step verification**

Use “2-step verification.” Don’t use “2 step verification” or “two-step verification.”

**3D Secure**

3D Secure is a fraud protection layer available to users as long as they’re using a participating payment gateway. Treat 3D Secure as a proper noun and capitalize accordingly.

### A

**able to**

Avoid using sentences using “You will be able to….” Instead, just say “You can….” It’s shorter and easier to scan.

**add**

Use “add” when referring to the act of putting a thing with another group of things. Compare this with “connect,” which refers to the act of joining two things together.

For example, users can add products to their catalog. They can also connect their BigCommerce site with a marketplace, like Amazon or Facebook.

**App Marketplace**

App Marketplace is a proper noun. Capitalize both words.

### B

**back**

“Back” means, “I want to return to the previous step in this workflow without quitting the current process.” Don’t use “back” in place of “cancel.”

**BigCommerce**

Use BigCommerce. Don’t use Bigcommerce or Big Commerce. And never abbreviate as BC.

**Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)**

Treat “Buy Now, Pay Later” as a branded, proper noun and use title case.

**buy online, pick up in-store (BOPIS)**

“Pick up” is a verb and should be two words, no hyphen. “In-store” is an adjective describing the type of pick up. In the UK, “buy online, pick up in-store” is called “click and collect.”

At BigCommerce, the default language for UX writing is American English. Accordingly, always use “buy online, pick up in-store.”

Don’t abbreviate as BOPIS.

### C

**cancel**

“Cancel” means, “I don’t want to do this anymore.” Any in-progress changes should be discarded as a result of clicking the button.

Don’t use “stop,” “pause,” “terminate” or “nevermind” and don’t use “cancel” in place of “back.”

**catalog**

A catalog is a collection of virtual representations of a merchant’s saleable products for a channel, stored within the BigCommerce platform. A catalog contains products. Products can be both physical and digital. For the latter, think music downloads, digital images, treatments, services, etc. A collection of products, sorted by the user for merchandising purposes, is called a category.

**category**

A collection of products, sorted by the user for merchandising purposes.

**channel**

A place where a BigCommerce user can market and sell goods. Channels include storefronts, marketplaces, advertising and social media.

**Channel Manager**

Channel Manager is a proper noun. Capitalize both words.

**check out, checkout**

Use check out (verb) when referring to the act of paying for items and creating an order.

Use checkout (noun) when talking about the place shoppers go to pay for items and create an order.

Use checkout (adjective) when describing the type of page or process.

Never use check-out.

Do

 - Ready to check out?
 - When you’re done shopping, proceed to the checkout.
 - Navigate to the checkout page.

**click**

Since we don’t know if a user is on a desktop or mobile device, avoid using “click” when instructing the user on how to complete an action within the UI. Whenever possible, write around the issue with generic verbs like “choose,” “select” or “pick.”

Avoid using “hit."

**clickthrough, click-through**

Use “clickthrough” (noun) when referring to an instance or multiple instances of clickthrough. Use “click through” (verb) when referring to the act of following a link or button to another site or location.

Don’t use “click-through.”

**close**

Use “close” instead of “exit” for modals and pop-ups.

**connect**

Use “connect” when referring to the act of joining two things together. Compare this to “add,” which refers to the act of putting a thing with another group of things.

For example, users can add products to their catalog. They can also connect their BigCommerce site with a marketplace, like Amazon or Facebook.

When writing about an integration between BigCommerce and another third party technology, you’ll probably be using “connect.”

**continue**

“Continue” means “I want to go forward a step in this workflow,” like an onboarding, for example.

Do not use “next.”

**control panel**

Control panel is not a proper noun. No need to capitalize. Of course, always capitalize the first letter of the first word if it appears at the start of a sentence. Keep in mind, there are very few instances when you’ll need to refer to the control panel by name. Most of the time you’ll just say “store.”

**create**

Use “create,” as opposed to “save,” as the CTA when creating a product, customer, setting, object, item etc. for the first time. When making changes to something that already exists, use “save” as the CTA.

**customer**

Use “customer” when referring to our users’ end-user: the customer. You can use “customer” and “shopper” interchangeably. Just keep in mind, depending on the context, there can be a subtle difference between a shopper and a customer. A shopper is a visitor to a merchant’s storefront who hasn’t necessarily purchased anything.

To avoid confusion, try not to use “customer” to refer to BigCommerce clients. Use “merchant,” “retailer” or “brand” instead.

### D

**delete**

Use “delete” for destructive behaviors. Don’t use “remove” or “dismiss.”

**deploy**

Use “deploy” when talking about a one-way connection between applications. If one application sends data to another, one time or on an occasional basis, it’s deploying.

On its own, as a clickable, UI item, use “details.” Don’t use “information” or “info.”

**Dev Center**

A resource center for developers looking to make their own solutions using the BigCommerce platform. Dev Center is a proper noun, so capitalize both words.

### F

**finish**

Use “finish” as the final CTA in a multi-step workflow, like an onboarding flow, for example.

### G

**got it**

“Got it” means “I understand.” Clicking “got it” is merely an acknowledgment on the part of the user. No change or action should take place as a result of clicking the button.

### H

**Optimized One-Page Checkout**

Treat as a branded, proper noun and capitalize accordingly.

**optional vs. required**

Label optional fields. Don’t label required fields. More often than not, a given settings page will have more required fields than optional fields. As such, it makes more sense to denote any optional fields as those are the ones deviating from the merchant’s expectations. Not to mention, it’s less cluttered looking than labeling all the required fields.

Also keep in mind, if a given setting has a default option, it’s not an optional setting and shouldn’t be labeled as such.

### P

“Pick up” is always a verb, as in “buy online, pick up in-store” or “in-store pick up” or “ready for pick up.”

“Pickup” can be an adjective or a noun. For example, “pickup methods.” In this example “pickup” is acting as an adjective modifying a noun. What kind of methods are these? They are pickup methods.

“Pickup” as a noun refers specifically to a type of vehicle. For example, Philip drives a pickup truck.

Never use “pick-up.”

**please**

Use “please” only when asking the user to go out of their way to do something. For example, “Please update your credit card info.” Otherwise, it’s okay to just ask the user to perform basic, everyday actions.

**pre-order**

Don’t use “preorder” or “pre order.”

**product**

A virtual representation of something a merchant sells on their BigCommerce store. A catalog contains products. Products can be both physical and digital. For the latter, think music downloads, digital images, treatments, services, etc. A collection of products, sorted by the user for merchandising purposes, is called a category.

**subtotal**

Use “subtotal,” one word. Don’t use “sub-total.”

**Support PIN**

Don’t use “support PIN,” “support pin,” “Support Pin” or any combination thereof. Also, PIN is an acronym for personal identification number so definitely don’t use “Support PIN number” as that would be redundant. Treat Support PIN as a proper noun and capitalize accordingly.
