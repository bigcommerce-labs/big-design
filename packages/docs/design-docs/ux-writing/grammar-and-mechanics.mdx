# Grammar and mechanics

## Capitalization

Use sentence case.

- Sentence case applies everywhere. This includes buttons, menus, headings, subheadings and titles.
  
- Capitalize [proper nouns](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/proper-nouns/ "https://www.grammarly.com/blog/proper-nouns/")
    
-   Capitalize the first word of every sentence
    
-   Lowercase everything else
    
-   When referring to items within the UI, capitalize exactly as the item appears in the UI. For example: "Click 'My profile' to change your password."

## Contractions

Contractions are handy for adjusting your tone. Using them makes your writing sound more casual. Not using them makes your writing sound more formal. That said, if you wouldn’t use the contraction in everyday speech, avoid using it in your writing. And while BigCommerce is a Texas company, let’s avoid “y’all,” y’all.

Do

Aren’t, can’t, couldn’t, could’ve, didn’t, don’t, doesn’t, hasn’t, haven’t, isn’t, let’s, shouldn’t, should’ve, that’s, there’s, they’re, we’ll, weren’t, we’ve, wasn’t, won’t, wouldn’t, you’ll, you’re

Don't

Ain’t, e’er, mightn’t, mustn’t, o’clock, shan’t, ‘twas, y’all

## Numbers

Always use numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) instead of writing out numbers (one, two, three, etc.). This is a big departure from traditional writing style. Keep in mind, you're writing for the web and the old rules were made with print in mind.

From [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-show-numbers-as-numerals/ "https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-show-numbers-as-numerals/") (NN/g):

> **When writing for the Web:**
> 
> - Write numbers with digits, not letters (23, not twenty-three).
> 
> - Use numerals even when the number is the first word in a sentence or bullet point.
> 
> - Use numerals for big numbers up to one billion:
> 
> - 2,000,000 is better than two million.
> 
> - Two trillion is better than 2,000,000,000,000 because most people can't interpret that many zeros.
> 
> - As a compromise, you can often use numerals for the significant digits and write out the magnitude as a word. For example, write 24 billion (not twenty-four billion or 24,000,000,000).

NN/g still recommends writing out numbers that don’t represent specific data. In the example below, it’s better to write out “thousands” than “1000s.”

Thousands of online stores are created using BigCommerce every year.

## Passive vs. active voice

Try to use the active voice. It’s simpler and more direct than the passive voice. Not sure what the difference is between active and passive? Here are some examples:

**Active**

 - Choose a payment method
 - We recommend…
 - Turn on the setting

**Passive**

 - Choose the preferred payment method
 - It is recommended…
 - The setting should be turned on

As you can see, with the passive voice it’s not clear who the subject is and who’s doing the acting. It’s indirect, confusing and wordy. Granted, writing in the active voice can sometimes feel too direct, even a little bossy. Users, however, appreciate it when you give them the info they need without a lot of fluff.

Of course, there are exceptions to the rule. Here’s when it might be okay to use the passive voice:

 -   To avoid referencing BigCommerce or your app by name when doing so would be distracting
    
 -   To make it clear that BigCommerce or your app didn’t personally take an action or make a decision; rather, the software took the action
    
 -   If the object or the action are more important than the subject doing the action

**Active**

 - BigCommerce creates and emails your invoices monthly to philip@nomail.com.
    
**Passive**

 - Invoices are created monthly and emailed to philip@nomail.com.



## Pluralities

A plurality occurs when the copy changes depending on the number of items you’re writing about. Whenever possible, write unique copy for the singular and plural forms, displaying the appropriate version as needed. If the possibility of a plural exists, but technological limitations prevent you from using variable copy, then default to the plural form.

Do

 - You have a new message.
 - You have 10 new messages.

Don't

 - You have a new message or messages.
 - You have a new message(s)

## Present vs. past tense

Write using the present tense. It’s immediate, direct and concise.

For confirmation, success and error messages it’s okay to use the past participle to express an action that was completed at some point in the past.

Past participles usually end with “-ed,” “-d,” “-t,” “-en” or “-n.”

Do

 - Settings saved
 - App installed
 - Payment failed
 - Message sent

Don't

 - Settings have been saved
 - App was installed
 - Payment has failed
 - Message was sent

## Punctuation and formatting

### Abbreviations and acronyms

For uncommon abbreviations/acronyms, write out the full phrase, followed by the abbreviation/acronym in parentheses in corresponding help text or a tooltip.

Do

 - A stock keeping unit (SKU) is a unique code that helps you keep track of an item or service in your inventory.

There’s no need to spell out commonly understood abbreviations and acronyms.

Do

 - Enter your PIN.

### Ampersands (&)

The ampersand (&) isn’t used in all languages and doesn’t localize well. Try and avoid using them unless it’s part of a company or brand name (for example, M&M's) or you’re trying to save on character count within the UI.

### Commas

Don’t use the serial comma, aka the Oxford comma, aka the comma before “and” in a list of 3 or more items.

Do

 - Planes, trains and automobiles.

Don't

 - Planes, trains, and automobiles.

It’s okay to use a serial comma if leaving the comma out causes ambiguity in the sentence’s meaning.

Do

 - This writing guide is dedicated to my parents, Olivia Rodrigo, and Harry Styles.

Don't

 - This writing guide is dedicated to my parents, Olivia Rodrigo and Harry Styles.

Use a comma before “but” if the “but” connects two independent clauses. In the example below, you can see each part of the sentence is an independent clause because each clause could stand on its own as two separate sentences.

Do

 - I would like to buy tickets to the Olivia Rodrigo concert, but the show is sold-out.

Generally, you should not use a comma before “because” if it's a subordinating conjunction. Its job is to join subordinate clauses to independent clauses.

Do

 - I had to return my new shoes because they were too small.

### Currencies

When referring to currencies, always use the 3-letter [ISO 4217 currency abbreviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217"). Don’t write out the full currency name. In many cases, the full name is less recognizable than the abbreviation.

When the currency abbreviation follows a monetary amount, put the abbreviation in parentheses.

Do

 - $100 (USD)

### Date, time and phone numbers

American English is the default language of UX writing at BigCommerce. As such, follow the American style of date, time and phone number notation.

**Date**
Use the 3-letter month abbreviations: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct and Nov. Do not use a period after the month name when abbreviating.

Use day-of-the-week abbreviations: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat and Sun. Do not use a period after the day when abbreviating.

Do

 - Jan 5, 2022
 - 1/02/22
 - Mon, Jan 5, 2022

**Time**

Don’t use periods in “AM” and “PM”

Be sure to check the region’s time zone and if it’s daylight savings time or not. For example, CDT is Central Daylight Time and CST is Central Standard Time.

Do

 - List item
 - 2:00 AM CST
 - 3:30 PM CDT

Don't

 - 2:00am CST
 - 3:30 P.M. CDT

**Phone numbers**

Use hyphens to break up phone numbers. Don’t use parentheses or periods.

Do

 - 1-888-555-5555

Don't

 - 1 (888) 555-5555
 - 1.888.555.5555

### Exclamation point

Save the exclamation point for something that’s actually exciting. Settings saved? Product added? Not too exciting. Doesn’t need an exclamation point.

### File extensions

There’s no need to write out file extensions in full. Always use the abbreviation, lowercase, no period.

Do

 - Uploads must be jpeg, png or gif.

Don't

 - Uploads must be JPEG, .png or Gif.

### Hyphens and dashes

**This is a hyphen (-)**

Hyphens are used to join compound words. Hyphens never have spaces around them.

**This is an en dash (–)**

En dashes are used to indicate a range between two numbers. Don’t put spaces around an en dash, unless you’re talking about dates featuring words. For example, May 3 – May 5.

If the number range is preceded by the words “from,” or “between,” then use the word “to” instead of an en dash.

Do

 - There are 500–1000 employees at BigCommerce.
 - There are somewhere between 500 to 1000 employees at BigCommerce.
 - Philip will be in the office May 3 – May 5.

**This is an em dash (—)**

Em dashes are used to indicate an abrupt pause or change in the middle of a sentence. Em dashes can also be used to call out or add emphasis to an important part of a sentence. Em dashes should always have a space before and after.

Do

 - Wait, that’s not a hyphen — it’s an em dash.
 - I went shopping — on a site powered by BigCommerce — and bought a new pair of jeans.

### Percentages

Use the “%” symbol instead of writing out the word.

### Periods

Do not use periods, or any ending punctuation of any kind, on titles, labels, headings, subheadings, numbered/bulleted lists or anything that a user can interact with (anything clickable). The latter category includes CTAs, buttons, menus and links outside of sentences.

Let’s look at an example:

<FigmaSample url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5KZNYdgysHmASmDvBZPP3m%2FGrammar-and-mechanics---Periods%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DUIeaPrF4qY34KuiX-1" aspect="landscape">
(View Example)[https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5KZNYdgysHmASmDvBZPP3m%2FGrammar-and-mechanics---Periods%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DUIeaPrF4qY34KuiX-1]
</FigmaSample> 

In the card above, the text above the divider qualifies as a header — it’s giving a name to the tile that it appears on — and doesn’t need a period.

The line of text below the divider needs a period because it’s just body text. It’s not giving a name to anything, it’s visually separated from the header and just too long to be a subheading.

As for the button, interactive items should never have ending punctuation of any kind.

### Quotation marks

Use quotation marks when referring, in the UI, to another item within the UI. This could be a page or area within a page. It could also be an item the user can interact with, for example, buttons, menus and links (anything clickable). This typically happens when writing help text or tooltips.

-   The quoted item should be written exactly as it appears in the UI
    
-   Ending punctuation always goes inside of the quotes
    
-   Don’t use bolding

Let’s look at an example:

<FigmaSample url="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5KZNYdgysHmASmDvBZPP3m%2FGrammar-and-mechanics---Periods%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DUIeaPrF4qY34KuiX-1" aspect="landscape">
(View Example)[https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5KZNYdgysHmASmDvBZPP3m%2FGrammar-and-mechanics---Periods%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DUIeaPrF4qY34KuiX-1]
</FigmaSample> 

Do

 - Under “List your products on Google,” click “Get started.”

### Slashes

You can use forward slashes “/” to indicate the word “or” between two words. When doing so, don’t use spaces before or after the slash. Don’t use backlashes “\”.

Do

 - if/when
 - and/or

On the other hand, when using a forward slash to signify “or” between two multi-word phrases, use spaces before and after the slash — it helps with readability.

Do

 - Download the app from the Apple App Store / Google Play Store.

### Units of measurement

Add a space between numbers and units of measurement. Use all lowercase and always abbreviate.

Don’t add a period. Don’t pluralize measurements (“lbs” is in common use and okay to use).

Do

 - 75 lbs, 14 in, 7 cm

When abbreviating units of data, always capitalize MB (megabyte) and GB (gigabyte). Don’t use Mb and Gb as these represent different units of measurement typically used when measuring Internet speeds.

Do

 - 10 MB, 10 GB
