# Interactions

An interaction is where the user’s intention becomes an action. It could be something as simple as a button or as complex as an entire checkout process. Whatever the case may be, the writing should be focused on what’s best for the user.

## Buttons

Users should know exactly what will happen when they click. Button language should be unambiguous, direct and action-oriented and 3 words at most.

 -   Follow the {verb} + {noun} formula
    
 -   Use sentence case and never include ending punctuation

## Checkout

When writing about the checkout process, follow established patterns. Ecommerce has been around long enough that users have strong expectations about what the process should look like.

Do

 - Add to cart
 - Check out
 - Check out securely
 - Go to checkout
 - View cart
 - Edit cart
 - Confirm payment
 - Place order

## Confirmations

When it comes to confirmation copy, there’s no room for ambiguity — especially when the action we’re trying to confirm is potentially destructive.

**Follow the {verb} + {noun} formula**

Use supporting copy to provide additional context as needed.

**Don’t ask vague questions**

“Are you sure?” About what? It’s not clear to the user what we’re trying to confirm.

Don't

**Always use “Cancel”**

Never use “stop,” “pause,” “terminate,” “never mind” or “back” when giving the user the option to back out.

**Write descriptive buttons**

When a user clicks a button, whether it’s to confirm an action or cancel one, it should be clear what will happen when they click.

## Deprecation

When deprecating an older feature it’s important to set the right tone. Calling the new version of the feature “advanced” makes it sounds harder to use. Calling the feature “new,” while true, also implies the feature is unproven. Instead, if a user has a choice between an older, deprecated version and a new version, just call the new version by its name — without any fancy adjectives.

## Empty states

Copy for empty states should tell the user why the field is empty and tell them how to start adding items.

## Error messages

There are two basic types of error messages: banner and in-line.

**Banner error messages**

For banner-type error messages, use the header to tell the user what went wrong and use the body to provide the solution. Whenever possible, save the user some trouble and provide a link to the place where the user can fix the error. It’s okay to include “Learn more” links to Knowledge Base articles.

Do

![Banner error, with header](blob:https://bigcommercecloud.atlassian.net/9ec92b86-eb27-413c-ae64-e57d35334d5c#media-blob-url=true&id=bef69584-1bd1-4f17-a336-99eb529ce7d3&collection=contentId-64716898&contextId=64716898&height=130&width=917&alt=)

For shorter banner messages that don’t include a header, lead with what went wrong, then follow with the solution. Always use ending punctuation. When applicable, include a link to the place where the user can fix the problem.

**In-line error messages**

For in-line error messages, keep the message short and to the point. Focus on what went wrong. If the solution isn’t obvious, it’s okay to go long on the copy. Always use ending punctuation.

Do

![In-line error message](blob:https://bigcommercecloud.atlassian.net/807ddf71-f21b-4a7c-90f8-e7fcad67fc9d#media-blob-url=true&id=4b30be46-7e82-4767-aa31-ead630a7f6d1&collection=contentId-64716898&contextId=64716898&height=124&width=359&alt=)

**Avoid vague language**

Don’t start error messages with “It seems like…” or “It looks like….” It sounds like we don’t know what went wrong.

Don't

![Don't write vague error messages](blob:https://bigcommercecloud.atlassian.net/b7b0c22f-bebf-4b7c-9119-8c12b43eaae2#media-blob-url=true&id=0ed3c0ff-4f85-48ab-b460-af89d902790b&collection=contentId-64716898&contextId=64716898&height=96&width=846&alt=)

**Use positive language**

Don’t use scary or dramatic words like “bad,” “forbidden,” “fatal,” “failed,” “unresolved,” “invalid” etc.

**Don’t mention error codes**

Error codes mean nothing to the average user.

**Avoid using “please”**

Only use “please” when asking the user to go out of their way to do something they might find inconvenient.

**Avoid humor**

Words and phrases like “Whoops” or “Oh no!” could be taken as inconsiderate, even insulting.

## Help text and tooltips

Help text and tooltips provide additional guidance to users when completing an action.

-   Link to relevant Knowledge Base articles whenever one exists
    

## Links in a sentence

Avoid linking entire sentences. Instead, link only the most relevant portion of the sentence. Use ending punctuation, as normal, but do not include ending punctuation in the link.

## Links outside of a sentence

Links outside of a sentence should follow the {verb} + {noun} format. Do not use periods or exclamation points. Question marks are fine within the context of a forgotten password link. Otherwise, avoid using them.

[Edit settings!](https://www.bigcommerce.com/ "https://www.bigcommerce.com/")

## Menus

Do not use ending punctuation on menu titles or items within a menu.

## Placeholder text

Placeholder text inside a form field should be short and have no periods. If it needs a period it’s too long. Keep in mind, placeholder text disappears when the user starts writing and if it’s too long to remember the user will need to delete what they’ve written to see the placeholder again.

If you’ve got a lot to say, present the info outside the field as help text.

## Titles, headings and subheadings

When writing titles, heading and subheadings:

-   Never use periods or other ending punctuation
    
-   Try to be brief
    
-   Titles should be titles, not sentences
