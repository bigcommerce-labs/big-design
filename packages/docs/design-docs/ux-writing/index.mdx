The purpose of the **BigCommerce UX writing guide** is to present a consistent, coherent and competent voice to BigCommerce merchants and their shoppers as it relates to in-product, customer-facing communication, aka microcopy.

Writers, researchers, designers and developers, both internal and external, who have a hand in designing BigCommerce products can refer to this guide anytime there’s a question about the writing.

- Not sure if you need a period at the end of a heading?

- Is there a difference between “log in” and “login?”

- Can the words “back” and “cancel” be used interchangeably?

The answers to these questions, and many more, can be found in the pages of this guide.
