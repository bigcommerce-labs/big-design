## Issues / Bugs

If you have a question, issue, or bug, you can open a Github issue. First, make sure to follow these instructions:

1. Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues within the BigDesign repo.
2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. (Instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue)). Be sure to include a title and clear description, and as much relevant information as possible. If possible, use the relevant template to create the issue. If none of the templates match your issue, open a regular issue. Currently supported templates are:
* **Bug report**: For situations in which you are experiencing an error with the library or a component itself. Expected functionality is specified per components [here](developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design/) and via design guidelines [here](https://design.bigcommerce.com/bigdesign).
	* Please include details to replicate the issue, including environment, OS, and any exceptions/backtraces
	* Include a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring when possible
* **Feature / Improvement Request**: For situations in which the library or a component are working as expected, but you desire additional functionality. This is the appropriate template for requesting new components.
* **Question**: For situations in which you need help from the BigCommerce engineering team, regarding guidance on using the BigDesign library, specific components, or other issues.
